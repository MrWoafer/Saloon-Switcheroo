# Saloon-Switcheroo
 
A 2-player local versus game made in 48 hours for the 2020 GMTK game jam.

Written in C# with Unity.

# How To Play

Run around the saloon and pick up items to use against your opponent:
* Glasses / Bottles
  * Throw at your opponent
* Pistol
  * Shoots one bullet at a time
  * 3 uses
* Shotgun
  * Shoots 3 bullets at once
  * 1 use
 
 If you hit your opponent 10 times, you win.

 Toppled tables can be moved and used as cover.

 If enabled, Switcheroo events will periodically occur:
 * Drunk
   * Your movement controls will be scrambled
 * Swap controls
   * Your controls swap with your opponent's
   * You must reach over each other or quickly swap seats
* Swap legs
   * You now control your opponent's movement
   * You still control your character's shooting
   * Items are automatically picked up
* Flip
   * All controls are returned to normal
   * The screen rotates 180 degrees
 
 The GUI shows your current controls to help.
